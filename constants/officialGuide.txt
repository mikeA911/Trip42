Right then. Eight brilliant tools. Let me be efficient about this:

1. **TRANSLATION (??)** — You're lost in a conversation or trying to order 
something complicated. This is your mate. I give you phrases, pronunciation, 
cultural context so you don't accidentally say something offensive.

2. **LOCAL (??)** — You wander into a neighborhood and I remind you: "Oh, 
you loved that vendor on this street. Want to go back?" It's your personal 
travel memory system.

3. **QUICK NOTES (?)** — Exhausted? Zaphod takes your messy typing and 
turns it into actual useful notes. Plus commentary. Mostly sass.

4. **HEALTH (??)** — Track your vitals, sleep, whatever. Patterns emerge. 
You'll actually understand what travel does to your body.

5. **EMERGENCY (??)** — When things go genuinely wrong. I become focused and 
practical. This is where I help you survive.

6. **TRAVEL (???)** — Where to next? How? What's actually worth seeing?  Click on the date/time on the landing page, click on a future date and add a note that can later help you plan your trip. 

7. **SLACKER  (???)**--Long wait huh? Try this tetris wannabe, you slacker

8. **APP HELP (??)** — You're confused. I clarify. No judgment, no condescension. Ask Arthur

That's it. Seven tools. One principle: You're not traveling alone.

Now, which one do you want to try first?
